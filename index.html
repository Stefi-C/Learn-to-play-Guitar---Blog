                    <div class="structure-desc">
                        <p>The first section of the guitar is called a headstock, on which you will find tuners 
                            and tuning pegs. 
                            The tuning pegs allow you tune the guitar by tightening or loosening the wires.

                            The middle, narrow section of the guitar is called the neck. The nut is the white strip 
                            closest to the headstock. The front side of the neck is called the fretboard. And the metal
                             wires on the fretboard are called the frets, which help your fingers find the right spots.
                             The biggest part of the guitar is called the body, which has a hole in the middle called the
                              sound hole. 
                            On the body, the bridge, the saddle, and the bridge pins hold the wires in place.</p>

                                <p>Most acoustic guitars come in a dreadnought shape in a standard parlor size.
                                     Parlor size guitars are typically smaller than a classical guitar, 
                                    but some are larger depending on the type of acoustic guitar manufacturer.
                                </p>

                                <p>Typically, a standard classical guitar has a wider neck than an acoustic guitar.
                                     Remember that an acoustic guitar is meant for strumming or fingerpicking; therefore,
                                      the smaller neck widths and shorter string spacing make these techniques easier for players.
                                       It’s also best to keep in mind that classical guitars tend to not have fret markers,
                                     which may or may not pose a challenge to players.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Bridge</h4>
                                <p>A classic wrap-around bridge is used on a standard classical guitar. 
                                    On this type of guitar, the strings are tied in a knot around the bridge to secure them in place,
                                     similar to a ukulele. But classical bridges also accept ball-end classical strings, which is the
                                      preferred string method for these types of rigs. In contrast,
                                     the bridge on an acoustic guitar has pegs that securely hold the strings in place.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>String</h4>
                                <p>The ultimate difference between an acoustic and a classical guitar is the strings. 
                                    Classical guitars use nylon strings as opposed to steel strings on an acoustic guitar.

                                    This is where the major differences in sound come from. Nylon strings are a lot thicker and
                                     produce a more mellow, softer sound than steel strings. The treble strings (G, B, high E) are
                                      made with nylon monofilament while the bass strings (E, A, D) feature a silver-plated copper
                                       wrapped around a nylon multifilament core. Nylon strings are softer to the touch and have a
                                        plastic feel, which makes them ideal for beginners.
                                    
                                    While the nylon strings might be easier to play for uncalloused hands, 
                                    the sound is not as common in modern music. If you like Spanish, Flamenco, or classical music,
                                     this type of sound can be achieved with a classical guitar. But most modern rock, folk, blues,
                                      and country performers use an acoustic guitar.
                                    
                                    The steel strings on an acoustic guitar produce a bright, crisp, even twangy sound that 
                                    resonates more than a classical guitar. Acoustic guitar strings are manufactured in 
                                    a variety of metals and materials, including nickel and bronze. These strings are thinner, 
                                    making them extremely similar 
                                    to electric guitar strings while also being somewhat sharper on the fingers.

                    <p>A plucked stringed musical instrument
                         that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra
                          latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The early guitar was
                           narrower and deeper than the modern guitar,
                           with a less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, 
                          the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute.</p>
                     </div>
 
                          
                    <p>
                        The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single,
                         that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly; 
                         the bridge thus sustained the direct pull of the strings. In the belly was a circular sound hole, 
                         often ornamented with a carved wooden rose. The 16th-century guitar was tuned C–F–A–D′, the tuning of
                         the centre four courses of the lute and of the 
                         vihuela.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument.
                         A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added.
                        Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E′,
                        still the standard tuning.<br>
                        The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head with rear tuning pegs;
                        in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the tuning pegs.
                         The early tied-on gut frets were replaced by built-on ivory or metal frets in the 18th century.
                         The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and several metal or ivory
                        frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century the fingerboard was raised 
                        slightly above the level of the belly and was extended across it to the edge of the sound hole.
                          In the 19th century the guitar’s body also underwent changes
                         that resulted in increased sonority. It became broader and shallower, with an extremely thin soundboard. Internally, the transverse bars reinforcing the soundboard 
                         were replaced by radial bars that fanned out below the sound hole. 
                         The neck, formerly set into a wood block, was formed into a brace, or shoe,
                          that projected a short distance inside the body and was glued to the back; this gave extra 
                          stability against the pull of the strings.<br>
                          The 19th-century innovations were largely the work of Antonio Torres. 
                          The instrument that resulted was the classical guitar, which is strung with three gut and three metal-spun silk strings.
                           Nylon or other plastic was later used in place of gut.<br>
                           Among variant forms of the guitar are the 12-stringed, or double-course, guitar,
                            and the Mexican jarana and the South American charango, both small five-course guitars.
                             Lyre-shaped guitars were fashionable in 19th-century drawing rooms. Other forms of the guitar
                              include the metal-strung guitar played with a plectrum in folk and popular music; the cello 
                              guitar, with a violin-type bridge and tailpiece; the Hawaiian, or steel, guitar, in which the
                               strings are stopped by the pressure of a metal bar, producing a sweet, gliding tone; and the 
                               electric guitar, in which the instrument’s sound and tone depend 
                           almost entirely on the electronic detection and amplification of its vibrating strings.<br>
                           Guitar music from the 16th to 18th century was notated either in tablature (showing the position of the fingers on the frets and the strings to be plucked) or in a system of alphabetical chord symbols. Jazz-guitar tablature shows chord symbols on a grid representing strings and frets.

                          The guitar grew in popularity during the 17th century as the lute and vihuela declined.
                          It remained an amateur’s instrument from the 17th to early 19th century. A few virtuoso guitarists, 
                          however, became known in Europe, among them Gaspar Sanz (flourished 1674), Robert de Visée 
                          (c. 1650–1725), Fernando Sor (1778–1839), and Joseph Kaspar Mertz (1806–56). 
                          Modern classical-guitar technique owes much to the Spaniard Francisco Tárrega (1852–1909), 
                          whose transcriptions of works by Bach, Mozart, 
                          and other composers formed the basis of the concert repertory.

                                        Ensure that your guitar is in tune. Get an electronic tuner to make
                                         sure that your guitar is tuned. Trying to learn how to play
                                          different songs with an untuned guitar can confuse you. 
                                        Also, many guides that you find online will be using standard tuning.

                                    <p> When you are sitting down, there are two main ways to hold your guitar. For a casual playing style,
                                         lay the guitar over your dominant leg. On the other hand, the classical method has you set your
                                          guitar on your non-dominant leg. In both instances, make sure that the guitar is held close 
                                          against your body. Holding your guitar properly makes it easier to play and prevents you from 
                                          becoming fatigued.
                                         Play around with both styles and figure out which one is most comfortable for you.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul class="points">
                                        <li>The classical style gives you more control over the neck of your guitar.</li>
                                        <li>The casual style reduces fatigue as you play.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure that the guitar is upright while you play because tilting the guitar can hurt your wrists.</li>
                                        <li>When standing, make sure that you have a strap on your guitar and that the guitar is tight against your torso, with the top of the guitar over your chest</li>
                                        <li>Maintain a relaxed posture as you play your guitar.</li>

                                    <p> Chords occur when you play two or more notes on different strings simultaneously 
                                        to create one unified sound. These are what make up the "rhythm" portion of acoustic music. 
                                        Single notes are used more for solos and occur when you play a single note at a time.
                                         Both are skills
                                         that you must become proficient in when learning to play the acoustic guitar

                                        Open chords are chords that are played towards the top of your guitar's neck, 
                                        near the tuning knobs. When playing the acoustic guitar, knowing the open chord shapes is 
                                        critical to play popular rhythms. Figure out two easy chords,
                                         like E minor and A major, for example, to get an understanding of their shape

                                        The dots on the chords represent where you should hold down your fingers on the neck.
                                         For instance, an A major is played by holding down the string on the second fret on the 2nd,
                                          3rd, and 4th string. An E minor is played by holding down the second fret on the 5th and 4th
                                           string. 
                                        Hold the strings down until they are pressed against the neck of your guitar

                                        other hand. Acoustic guitar strings often have higher actions than electric guitars, so you
                                         may have to press down very hard to get a good sound. If the chord comes out muted, try holding 
                                         down the strings with more force.
                                         If your string is buzzing, move your finger further away from the metal fret on your neck

                                        Now instead of strumming on one chord, practice going back and forth between your

                                         try strumming it at different tempos and rhythms. 
                                         Rhythm is based on your strumming pattern, and how long you're holding your notes.
                                          Try a basic 1-2-3-4 beat, otherwise known as a 4/4. The number on the top represents
                                           how many beats there are in the measure. Try strumming up and down in different progressions
                                            to create a different sound for your rhythm. Once you get a basic rhythm down,
                                         you can start to incorporate quicker or slower strumming.

                                  a 2 means the second fret, and so on. Numbers in a progression mean that you hold down

                                        the various chords quickly. These transition periods are often the hardest for 
                                        beginners to play when they are starting off. The more you practice between switching 
                                        to different chords, however, the better you'll get at doing it in songs. 
                                        Practice switching between open chords like G, A, E, and C.

                                        Consistent practice will allow you to improve your guitar playing skills 
                                        over a short period. Taking long breaks and not staying dedicated will wear
                                         away your muscle memory and delay the development of your skills. Instead, 
                                         dedicate 20 minutes to an hour of practice throughout most of the week. During practice,
                                         you can either run different drills or you can try covering a song.

                    <p>The guitar, I never thought I'd play it one day, I remember looking at it since I was little as a difficult instrument to learn and thinking that only a few people born 
                        with the gift for it had the chance to learn.
                        Furthermore, I didn't even think it could become my favorite instrument, I was convinced that my instrument would have been the piano, I love its sound very much and 
                        I dreamed of being able to play it one day, I was mistakenly convinced that as an instrument it was easier to learn. So for me the guitar was an instrument that I didn't 
                        consider.</p>
                    <div class="circle3"></div>

                <div class="circular-sb2">
                    <p>Although I had a lot of admiration for those who played it and many times I found myself dreaming of being able to play this instrument,
                         quickly shaking that thought off, 
                        convinced that I would never be able to do it. I have a daughter who wanted to play the guitar instead and she enrolled in a course at her high school, asked me to buy her a guitar and a few months later lost interest.
                         I found the guitar, abandoned in her room with a broken string and decided to figure out how to fix it with the hope that interest would return, having no idea how to do
                          it, I searched the internet.</p>

                <div class="circular-sb1">
                    <p>But my daughter hadn't lost interest in the guitar, she had no interest in how they taught her at school. So I decided to at least try to 
                        understand something about that instrument, trying to see if I could find a way to make her want to learn again.
                      I took a notebook and started searching in internet for sites, videos and information on how to play the guitar, and took note. Then I started ti try to learn how to play.
                       For the first few months it was quite frustrating,
                       I had no idea if I was learning well, my fingers hurt terribly, I couldn't get a round of chords, despite trying and trying again.</p>

                    <p>But one day, from one moment to 
                        the next it was as if something was unlocked inside my brain, and I was able to play a complete round of chords. Since then my desire to learn increased, I began to 
                        learn to play more and more songs, I was obsessed with wanting to play, it gave me pleasure to do it to the point that I used to ran home and grabb the guitar
                         every time I heard a song I liked it. It's only been 3 years since then and it has become something crucial in my life, it's a 
                         part of it. It is my favorite hobby of all.</p>

                <p>
                    Everyone is creative deep down. When you play the guitar, you'll connect with that creativity and be able to express things more authentically. 
                    You'll also learn what it is to get into a flow state. This is the state of being fully immersed in what you're doing, such as playing guitar and enjoying it.
                    You don't have to be an expert guitar player to reap the benefits. Just picking one up and letting the music take over is enough.
